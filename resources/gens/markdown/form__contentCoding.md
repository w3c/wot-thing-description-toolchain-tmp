Content coding values indicate an encoding transformation that has been or can be applied to a representation.  Content codings are primarily used to allow a representation to be compressed or otherwise usefully transformed  without losing the identity of its underlying media type and without loss of information. Examples of content coding include \"gzip\", \"deflate\", etc.
