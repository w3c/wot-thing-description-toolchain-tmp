  SecurityScheme:
    description: >-
      Metadata describing the configuration of a security mechanism. The value assigned to the name scheme MUST be defined 
      within a Vocabulary included in the Thing Description. For all security schemes, any keys, passwords, or other 
      sensitive information directly providing access MUST NOT be stored in the TD and should instead be shared and 
      stored out-of-band via other mechanisms.

  DigestSecurityScheme:

  NoSecurityScheme:
    is_a: SecurityScheme
