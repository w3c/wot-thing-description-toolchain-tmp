  OperationType:
    description: >-
      Well-known operation types for WoT interaction model. The list of possible operation types of a form is fixed. 
      As of this version of the specification, it only includes the well-known types necessary to implement the WoT 
      interaction model.

      - Consumer to Thing applies for messages sent by the Consumer to the Thing
      - Thing to Consumer applies for messages sent by the Thing to the Consumer
      - No correlation implies no payload is required or expected
