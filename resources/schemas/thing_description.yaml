  This schema defines the classes required for modelling the W3C Web of Things information model
  according to the W3C WoT Group (https://github.com/w3c/wot). This schema is based on LinkML and is used to generate 
  the required WoT resources e.g., JSON Schema, SHACL shapes, and RDF programmatically.
