classes:

  Link:
    class_uri: hctl:Link
    description: >-
      A link can be viewed as a statement of the form link context that has a relation type resource at link target, where the optional target attributes may further describe the resource.
    attributes:
      type:
        description: Target attribute providing a hint indicating what the media type [IANA-MEDIA-TYPES] of the result of dereferencing the link should be.
        slot_uri: hctl:hintsAtMediaType
      relation:
        description: >-
          A link relation type identifies the semantics of a link.
      anchor:
        description: >-
          By default, the context, or anchor, of a link conveyed in the Link header field is the URL of the representation it is associated with, as defined in RFC7231, Section 3.1.4.1, and is serialized as a URI.
        range: anyUri
      sizes:
        description: >-
          Target attribute that specifies one or more sizes for the referenced icon. Only applicable for relation type 'icon'. The value pattern follows {Height}x{Width} (e.g., \"16x16\", \"16x16 32x32\").
      hreflang:
        description: >-
          The hreflang attribute specifies the language of a linked document. The value of this must be a valid language tag [[BCP47]].
        multivalued: true
        pattern: "^(((([A-Za-z]{2,3}(-([A-Za-z]{3}(-[A-Za-z]{3}){0,2}))?)|[A-Za-z]{4}|[A-Za-z]{5,8})(-([A-Za-z]{4}))?(-([A-Za-z]{2}|[0-9]{3}))?(-([A-Za-z0-9]{5,8}|[0-9][A-Za-z0-9]{3}))*(-([0-9A-WY-Za-wy-z](-[A-Za-z0-9]{2,8})+))*(-(x(-[A-Za-z0-9]{1,8})+))?)|(x(-[A-Za-z0-9]{1,8})+)|((en-GB-oed|i-ami|i-bnn|i-default|i-enochian|i-hak|i-klingon|i-lux|i-mingo|i-navajo|i-pwn|i-tao|i-tay|i-tsu|sgn-BE-FR|sgn-BE-NL|sgn-CH-DE)|(art-lojban|cel-gaulish|no-bok|no-nyn|zh-guoyu|zh-hakka|zh-min|zh-min-nan|zh-xiang)))$"

  Form:
    class_uri: hctl:Form
    description: >-
      A form can be viewed as a statement of to perform an operation type on form context, 
      make a request method to submission target, where the optional form fields
      may further describe the required request. In Thing Descriptions, the form context is the surrounding Object, 
      such as Properties, Actions, and Events or the Thing itself for meta-interactions.
    attributes:
      contentType:
        slot_uri: hctl:forContentType
        description: >-
          Assign a content type based on a media type IANA-MEDIA-TYPES (e.g., 'text/plain') and potential parameters 
          (e.g., 'charset=utf-8') for the media type.
      contentCoding:
        description: >-
          Content coding values indicate an encoding transformation that has been or can be applied to a representation. 
          Content codings are primarily used to allow a representation to be compressed or otherwise usefully transformed 
          without losing the identity of its underlying media type and without loss of information. Examples of content
          coding include \"gzip\", \"deflate\", etc.
      securityDefinitions:
        description: >-
          A security schema applied to a (set of) affordance(s).
        slot_uri: td:hasSecurityConfiguration

        multivalues: true
      scopes:

          TODO Check, was not in hctl ontology, if not could be source of discrepancy
        multivalued: true
      response:
        description: >-
          This optional term can be used if, e.g., the output communication metadata differ from input metadata (e.g., output contentType differ from the
          input contentType). The response name contains metadata that is only valid for the response messages.
        slot_uri: hctl:returns
        range: ExpectedResponse
      additionalResponse:
        description: >-
          This optional term can be used if additional expected responses are possible, e.g. for error reporting. Each
          additional response needs to be distinguished from others in some way (for example, by specifying a protocol-specific
          response code), and may also have its own data schema.
        slot_uri: hctl:additionalReturns
        range: AdditionalExpectedResponse
        multivalued: true
      subprotocol:
        slot_uri: hctl:forSubProtocol
        description: >-
          Indicates the exact mechanism by which an interaction will be accomplished for a given protocol when there
          are multiple options.
      op:
        description:
          Indicates the semantic intention of performing the operation(s) described by the form. TODO- Check, in the ontology this does not have a connecting link between operation and OperationType.

    description: >-
      Communication metadata describing the expected response message for the primary response.

        slot_uri: hctl:forContentType
        description: >- 
          TODO Check, was not in hctl ontology, if not could be source of discrepancy. 
          Assign a content type based on a media type IANA-MEDIA-TYPES (e.g., 'text/plain') and potential parameters 
          (e.g., 'charset=utf-8') for the media type.

    description: >-

      success:
        slot_uri: hctl:isSuccess
        description: >-

        range: boolean
      schema:
        slot_uri: hctl:hasAdditionalOutputSchema
        description: >-
          This optional term can be used to define a data schema for an additional response if it differs from the default
          output data schema. Rather than a DataSchema object, the name of a previous definition given in a SchemaDefinitions
          map must be used.
      contentType:
        slot_uri: hctl:forContentType
        description: >-
          Assign a content type based on a media type IANA-MEDIA-TYPES (e.g., 'text/plain') and potential parameters 
          (e.g., 'charset=utf-8') for the media type.
