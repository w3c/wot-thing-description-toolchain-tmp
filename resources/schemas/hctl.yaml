  Link:
    class_uri: hctl:Link
    description: >-
      A link can be viewed as a statement of the form link context that has a relation type resource at link target, 
      where the optional target attributes may further describe the resource.
    attributes:
      type:
        description: Target attribute providing a hint indicating what the media type [IANA-MEDIA-TYPES] of the result of dereferencing the link should be.
        slot_uri: hctl:hintsAtMediaType
      rel:
        description: >-
          A link relation type identifies the semantics of a link.
        slot_uri: hctl:hasRelationType
      anchor:
        description: >-
          By default, the context, or anchor, of a link conveyed in the Link header field is the URL of the 
          representation it is associated with, as defined in RFC7231, Section 3.1.4.1, and is serialized as a URI.
        slot_uri: hctl:hasAnchor
        range: uri
      sizes:
        description: >-
          Target attribute that specifies one or more sizes for the referenced icon. Only applicable for relation type 
          'icon'. The value pattern follows {Height}x{Width} (e.g., \"16x16\", \"16x16 32x32\").
        slot_uri: hctl:hasSizes
      hreflang:
        description: >-
          The hreflang attribute specifies the language of a linked document. The value of this must be a valid 
          language tag [[BCP47]].
        slot_uri: hctl:hasHreflang

    slots:
      - href
  Form:
    class_uri: hctl:Form
    description: >-
      A form can be viewed as a statement of to perform an operation type on form context, 
      make a request method to submission target, where the optional form fields
      may further describe the required request. In Thing Descriptions, the form context is the surrounding Object, 
      such as Properties, Actions, and Events or the Thing itself for meta-interactions.
    attributes:
      contentType:
        slot_uri: hctl:forContentType
        description: >-
          Assign a content type based on a media type IANA-MEDIA-TYPES (e.g., 'text/plain') and potential parameters 
          (e.g., 'charset=utf-8') for the media type.
      contentCoding:
        description: >-
          Content coding values indicate an encoding transformation that has been or can be applied to a representation. 
          Content codings are primarily used to allow a representation to be compressed or otherwise usefully transformed 
          without losing the identity of its underlying media type and without loss of information. Examples of content
          coding include \"gzip\", \"deflate\", etc.
        slot_uri: hctl:forContentCoding
      scopes:
        description: >-
          Set of authorization scope identifiers provided as an array. These are provided in tokens returned by an 
          authorization server and associated with forms in order to identify what resources a client may access and how. 
          The values associated with a form SHOULD be chosen from those defined in an OAuth2SecurityScheme active on that form.

      response:
        description: >-
          This optional term can be used if, e.g., the output communication metadata differ from input metadata (e.g., output contentType differ from the
          input contentType). The response name contains metadata that is only valid for the response messages.

      additionalResponse:
        description: >-
          This optional term can be used if additional expected responses are possible, e.g. for error reporting. Each
          additional response needs to be distinguished from others in some way (for example, by specifying a protocol-specific
          response code), and may also have its own data schema.

          are multiple options.

      op:
        description:
          Indicates the semantic intention of performing the operation(s) described by the form. TODO- Check, in the ontology this does not have a connecting link between operation and OperationType.

          Assign a content type based on a media type IANA-MEDIA-TYPES (e.g., 'text/plain') and potential parameters

      schema:
        slot_uri: hctl:hasAdditionalOutputSchema
        description: >-
          This optional term can be used to define a data schema for an additional response if it differs from the default
          output data schema. Rather than a DataSchema object, the name of a previous definition given in a SchemaDefinitions
          map must be used.
      contentType:
        slot_uri: hctl:forContentType
        description: >-
          Assign a content type based on a media type IANA-MEDIA-TYPES (e.g., 'text/plain') and potential parameters
