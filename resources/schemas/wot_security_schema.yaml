  SecurityScheme:
    class_uri: wotsec:SecurityScheme
    description: >-
      Metadata describing the configuration of a security mechanism. The value assigned to the name scheme MUSTbe 
      defined within a data-link-type Vocabulary included in the data-link-type, either in the standard Vocabulary 
      defined in TD Information Model or in a TD Context Extension.
    attributes:

        range: MultiLanguage
      proxy:
        description: >-
          URI of the proxy server this security configuration provides access to. If not given, the corresponding security configuration
          is for the endpoint.

        range: SecuritySchemeType

  BearerSecurityScheme:
    is_a: SecurityScheme
    description: >-
      Bearer token authentication security configuration identified by the term <code>bearer.  This scheme is intended 
      for situations where bearer tokens are used independently of OAuth2.  If the oauth2 scheme is specified it is not 
      generally necessary to specify this scheme as well as it is implied.  For format, the value jwt indicates conformance 
      with RFC7519, jws indicates conformance with RFC7797, cwt indicates conformance with RFC8392, and jwe indicates 
      conformance with !RFC7516, with values for alg interpreted consistently with those standards. 
      Other formats and algorithms for bearer tokens MAY be specified in vocabulary extensions.
    attributes:
      alg:
        description: >-
          Encoding, encryption, or digest algorithm.
      format:
        description: >-
          Specifies format of security authentication information.

  OAuth2SecurityScheme:
    is_a: SecurityScheme
    description: >-
      OAuth 2.0 authentication security configuration for systems conformant with [[!RFC6749]] and [[!RFC8252]], identified 
      by the Vocabulary Term oauth2. For the code flow both authorization and token MUST be included. For the client
      flow token MUST be included. For the client flow authorization MUST NOT be included. For the device flow both 
      authorization and token MUST be included. In the case of the device flow the value provided for authorization
      refers to the device authorization endpoint defined in [[!RFC8628]].
    attributes:
      flow:
        description: >-
          Authorization flow.
        required: true

        description: >-
          URI of the refresh server.
        range: anyURI
      scopes:
        description: >-
          Set of authorization scope identifiers provided as an array.  These are provided in tokens returned by an 
          authorization server and associated with forms in order to identify what resources a client may access and how.  
          The values associated with a form should be chosen from those defined in an OAuth2SecurityScheme active on that form.
        multivalued: true
    slots:
      - authorization

  ComboSecurityScheme:
    is_a: SecurityScheme
    description: >-
      A combination of other security schemes identified by the Vocabulary Term combo. Elements of this scheme define 
      various ways in which other named schemes defined in securityDefinitions, including other ComboSecurityScheme definitions, 
      are to be combined to create a new scheme definition. Exactly one of either oneOf or allOf MUST be included.
    attributes:
      oneOf:
        description: >-
          Array of two or more strings identifying other named security scheme definitions, any one of which, when satisfied, 
          will allow access.  Only one may be chosen for use.
        multivalued: true
      allOf:
        description: >-
          Array of two or more strings identifying other named security scheme definitions, all of which must be satisfied for access.
        multivalued: true

  DigestSecurityScheme:
    is_a: SecurityScheme
    description: >-
      Digest authentication security configuration identified by the term digest. This scheme is similar to basic 
      authentication but with added features to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks.
    attributes:
      qop:
        description: >-
          Quality of protection
    slots:
      - name

  BasicSecurityScheme:
    is_a: SecurityScheme
    description: >-
      Basic authentication security configuration identified by the term basic, using an unencrypted username and password.
    slots:
      - name
      - in

  NoSecurityScheme:
    is_a: SecurityScheme
    description: >-
      A security configuration corresponding to identified by the term nosec, indicating there is no authentication or 
      other mechanism required to access the resource.

  AutoSecurityScheme:
    is_a: SecurityScheme
    description: >-
      An automatic authentication security configuration identified by the term auto. 
      This scheme indicates that the security parameters are going to be negotiated by the underlying protocols at runtime, 
      subject to the respective specifications for the protocol (e.g. [[!RFC8288]] for Basic Authentication when using HTTP).

  APISecurityScheme:
    is_a: SecurityScheme
    description: >-
      API key authentication security configuration identified by the term apikey.  This scheme is to be used when the 
      access token is opaque, for example when a key in a proprietary format is provided by a cloud service provider.  
      In this case the key may not be using a standard token format. This scheme indicates that the key provided by the 
      service provider needs to be supplied as part of service requests using the mechanism indicated by the \"in\" field.
    slots:
      - name
      - in

  PSKSecurityScheme:
    is_a: SecurityScheme
    description: >-
      Pre-shared key authentication security configuration identified by the term psk.  
      This is meant to identify that a standard is used for pre-shared keys such as TLS-PSK [[rfc4279]], and that the 
      ciphersuite used for keys will be established during protocol negotiation.
    attributes:
      identity:
        description: >-
          Identifier providing information which can be used for selection or confirmation.

  APIKeySecurityScheme:
    is_a: SecurityScheme
    description: >-
      Pre-shared key authentication security configuration identified by the term psk.  
      This is meant to identify that a standard is used for pre-shared keys such as TLS-PSK [[rfc4279]], and that the 
      ciphersuite used for keys will be established during protocol negotiation.
