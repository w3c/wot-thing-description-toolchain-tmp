      Metadata describing data of type string. This Subclass is indicated by the value string assigned to type 
      in DataSchema instances.

  NullSchema:
    is_a: DataSchema
    description: >-
      Metadata describing data of type null. This subclass is indicated by the value null assigned to type in DataSchema 
      instances. This Subclass describes only one acceptable value, namely null. It is important to note that null does 
      not mean the absence of a value. It is analogous to null in JavaScript, None in Python, null in Java and nil in 
      Ruby programming languages. It can be used as part of a oneOf declaration, where it is used to indicate, that 
      the data can also be null.
