# WoT Schemas

The WoT Schemas contains the single, main source of data for all the officially provided WoT resources.

The WoT Schema provides YAML files in [linkml](https://linkml.io) format as its primary information source, which contain specific classes with their attributes
and respective information like attributes' datatypes or cardinalities.

These YAML files are then used to create the necessary WoT resource files.
